## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains **demographic, employment, and financial attributes** of loan applicants.

### Target Variable
- `loan_status`
  - `0` → Safe applicant
  - `1` → Risky applicant

### Key Features
| Feature | Description |
|------|------------|
| person_age | Applicant age |
| person_income | Annual income |
| person_home_ownership | RENT / OWN / MORTGAGE |
| person_emp_length | Employment length |
| loan_intent | Purpose of loan |
| loan_grade | Credit grade (A–G) |
| loan_amnt | Loan amount |
| loan_int_rate | Interest rate |
| loan_percent_income | Loan burden |
| cb_person_default_on_file | Previous default |
| cb_person_cred_hist_length | Credit history length |

## ⚙️ Data Preprocessing

- Missing value handling using **median & most-frequent imputation**
- Categorical encoding via **OneHotEncoder**
- Feature scaling using **StandardScaler**
- Pipeline-based preprocessing to prevent data leakage
- Class imbalance handled using **SMOTE**

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

### Algorithm Used
- **XGBoost Classifier**

### Mathematical Formulation

The model predicts probability using:

\[
z = \sum_{k=1}^{K} f_k(x)
\]

\[
P(\text{Risky}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
\]

### Decision Rule
\[
\text{If } P \ge 0.5 \Rightarrow \text{Risky}, \quad \text{Else Safe}
\]

## 📈 Model Evaluation

Metrics used:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC–AUC Curve
- Confusion Matrix

The model achieved **high recall for risky applicants**, which is critical in financial risk assessment.

## 🔍 Explainable AI (XAI)

### 1️⃣ Rule-Based Explainability (Online)
Displayed directly in the Streamlit app:

- High loan-to-income ratio
- High interest rate
- Short credit history
- Previous default
- Low employment stability

### 2️⃣ SHAP Explainability (Offline)
- SHAP values computed offline using **KernelExplainer**
- Global feature importance visualized
- SHAP plots displayed in Streamlit dashboard

This hybrid approach ensures **both transparency and system stability**.
